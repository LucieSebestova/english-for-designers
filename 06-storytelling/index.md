# THE TIME WE HAVE
by Lucie Å ebestovÃ¡

This storytelling is about the limited time we have in our lives. 

It isn't going to be like that movie IN TIME, where everyone has time on their hands to pay rent and stuff.
Nevertheless, I would like to remind you in this form here that life is not infinite and therefore we must enjoy it as much as possible.Go head-to-head, don't be afraid of little things, don't stress about stupid things and don't waste time on things that aren't important.


Dig deep into your life and enjoy it in mouthfuls!


Are you ready for the DIVE?
LET'S DO IT!

## HELLO!
So, at firstâ€¦ Hi! My name is Lucy, as you all probably know.
â€¦I study graphic design at the University of Prague. During my studies I work as an external graphic designer for a housing company. Besides, I like to create various illustrations from realistic crayon drawing to digital drawing. 
In my free time, I like to read, spend time with my friends and explore new things.
It was through travelling that I discovered the magic of diving.

I officially did my Open Water Diver course in Bali in 2016. 
My instructor was Chris Bush, a great guy by the way. ðŸ˜„
He was fun. If you ever want to meet good people abroad, divers are the obvious choice!
They're all cool and you never get bored with them. I PROMISE. 

### About the course (Open Water Diver)
This course officially allows me to dive to a depth of 12 meters. This course included a written test and a practical underwater test where, for example, we had to remove our diving goggles, put them back on and get rid of the excess water left in them.

## What will my story be about?
I will talk about THE TIME WE HAVE. The reason why I chose to talk about this topic is that nothing in our lives is constant. Everything is changing, nothing is everlasting, and neither are we here forever. None of us areâ€¦

Butâ€¦don't worry, I don't want to stress here and create some feelings of depression and fear of what's coming. My intention is to make you aware of a few things that I often forget, too. 

## HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER DIVED? 
This question may be a little confusing, but I will still ask... Have any of you ever dived?
Some of you might, some of you might not. If not, never mind. We are in a specialization where imagination and creativity plays a big part, so you can certainly use your imagination to the full.


You may be wondering what our time has to do with diving. But you would be surprised at how closely they can be related.
When you dive and you are under the water, you have just short time to explore all the beautiful things under the water, and itâ€™s like our life. 
And thatâ€™s what I want to talk about today.

Butâ€¦let's start at the beginning. Imagine you're on a boat that's tossing from side to side, wobbling to the rhythm of the waves...You might be slightly nauseous and maybe little nervous about it and NOW it's time to get ready for the dive.
In the neoprene with your heavy tank on your back and your fins, that make it hard for you to moveâ€¦you hobble to the edge of the boat and jump. You were just born. When all the bubbles are brought to the surface, you can look around and get used to the environment where you are. And that's your first phase of your life.

## WHAITâ€¦WHERE AM I?
So, when you get used to environment, you make your own moves to look around and find what you can explore. And the whole ocean is SO huge, and it's only up to you, where you will dive and what you will see â€“ and same thing is with your life.
YOU decide what you gonna do.
YOU look for what you like.
And YOU decide how you spend your time, that is limited.
