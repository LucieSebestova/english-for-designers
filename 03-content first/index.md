## About me
Hi again, I'm Lucie (Lucy)! 
I'm graphic designer and illustrator and my favorite companion at work is 🍷… just kidding… I prefer white wine. 😜


## My story 

![black and white photo, smiling, friendly face](1635094893843 (1).jpg)

Already as a child, I enjoyed drawing. That's why I started going to Art school of Jindřicha Pravečka, where I developed my skills in drawing and painting.  It wasn't until high school that I learned how to work with programs like photoshop and illustrator. Through this school, I have learned what I enjoy and what I want to do in my future. 

Besides, I like to spend time with my family and friends and maybe that's one of the reasons I do all my work at the last minute.

...and here, at the age of 5, my artistic career began to appear! 😅



## Case study

### Bydlení Brusy

Before I start talking about Bydlení Brusy, I have to mention something about Základy bydlení.
Základy bydlení is company creating modern family living. They are based in Brmo and focuses on reconstructions and new-builds. For this company I have created a new visual identity in the past.

Bydlení Brusy is a project that comes under the company Základy bydlení. It's project of new-builds 4 terraced apartment buildings and 24 single-family houses in Rosice.
And for this project they asked me for a new logo. 

####DATES
July 2022–November 2022

####FIRST BRIEF
The client described in an e-mail that the apartment buildings would be in nature by the woods and fields where the sun shines.
So they asked me for a simple logo that would have the elements of nature mentioned.
They also wanted the logo be similar, or somehow associated with the logo of Základy Bydlení.

Based on these requirements, my first version of the logo was this.
