# THE TIME WE HAVE
by Lucie Šebestová

This storytelling is about the limited time we have in our lives. 

It isn't going to be like that movie IN TIME, where everyone has time on their hands to pay rent and stuff.
Nevertheless, I would like to remind you in this form here that life is not infinite and therefore we must enjoy it as much as possible.Go head-to-head, don't be afraid of little things, don't stress about stupid things and don't waste time on things that aren't important.


Dig deep into your life and enjoy it in mouthfuls!


Are you ready for the DIVE?
LET'S DO IT!

- If you're wondering how I got to this final version, here is my [process](process.md).

## HELLO!
So, at first… Hi! My name is Lucy, as you all probably know.
…. I study graphic design at the University of Prague. During my studies I work as an external graphic designer for a housing company. Besides, I like to create various illustrations from realistic crayon drawing to digital drawing. 
In my free time, I like to read, spend time with my friends and explore new things.
It was through travelling that I discovered the magic of diving. 


I officially did my Open Water Diver course in Bali in 2016. 
My instructor was Chris Bush, a great guy by the way.
He was fun. If you ever want to meet good people abroad, divers are the obvious choice! They're all cool and you never get bored with them. I PROMISE.
