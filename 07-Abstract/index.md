# Abstract

The work deals with the visual identity of the town of Lanškroun. A comparative analysis of the visual identities of cities has revealed that most major cities have modern and comprehensive identities that are modern and functional. In contrast, smaller cities often lack the completeness of visual identity. These cities usually have only a logo that they work with only in an impact fulcrum, rather replacing it with the emblem of their city. So, too, is the city of Lanškroun.
This thesis contains an explanation of basic concepts such as visual identity, brand, and its communication, what a rebrand is and why to rebrand. In another section, it summarizes the historical facts of the founding and development of Lanškroun. The results of the analysis of the existing visual style and its functionality, a survey of selected comparable competing cities and their visual presentation, and an example of the appropriately and effectively addressed visual identity of the Czech city are part of the work. 
Based on the survey, a new visual style of the town of Lanškroun is proposed. The conclusion of the work presents the description and reasoning of the style created, takes it into account in a comprehensive evaluation of its information and communication potential, and explains the graphic means chosen – rendering of the image component, the font used, and the color.
