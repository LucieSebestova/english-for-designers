# THE TIME WE HAVE
by Lucie Šebestová

This storytelling is about the limited time we have in our lives. 

It isn't going to be like that movie IN TIME, where everyone has time on their hands to pay rent and stuff.
Nevertheless, I would like to remind you in this form here that life is not infinite and therefore we must enjoy it as much as possible.Go head-to-head, don't be afraid of little things, don't stress about stupid things and don't waste time on things that aren't important.


Dig deep into your life and enjoy it in mouthfuls!
