# First Impression

## About me 

My name is Lucie. I study graphic design at the University of Prague. During my studies I work as an external graphic designer for a housing company. Next, I take part in various graphic competitions, which I try to gain more experience and learn something new. 
Besides, I like to create various illustrations from realistic crayon drawing to digital drawing. I like to combine my illustrations with used graphics.

## Featured Project

### Zahradnictv√≠ Spomy≈°l

#### Intro
Zahradnictv√≠ Spomy≈°l is currently the largest online seller of plants in The Czech Republic and Slovakia. Their e-shop is visited by over two million users every year and sends over 100,000 shipments of plants.
¬†Such great success on the market makes it surprising how little attention they pay to visual identity. They didn't have a complete style, they used different colours and fonts. Also their websites were outdated and didn't make a very good impression.
That's¬†why I have chosen to rebrand this brand¬†to improve and complete the identity to match the quality and level of this online horticulture. I also emphasize packaging, which would be more interesting and engaging.

#### Logo
I wanted to simplify the logo more. The new logo is only typographical ‚Äì Quicksand font, to enhance freshness and elegance. A combination of two leafs replaced the hook.

#### Colors and new pattern
I kept the color combination of black and green. However, I opted for a different green to make it more vibrant.

¬†Since the beginning of the creation, I wanted to create something that would differ from other horticultures.¬†For this reason I created a pattern made of leaves that accompanies the entire graphic.

This was only a school project, but I still decided to add it here because I gained a lot of new experience on this project. I also enjoyed this work very much and wanted to share it with you. And of course, if possible I would like to offer it to this horticulture. üòä
It takes me about a month to create this new visual identity.¬†
