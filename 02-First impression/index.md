## About me 

My name is Lucie. I study graphic design at the University of Prague. During my studies I work as an external graphic designer for a housing company. Next, I take part in various graphic competitions, which I try to gain more experience and learn something new. 
Besides, I like to create various illustrations from realistic crayon drawing to computer drawing. I like to combine my illustrations with used graphics.
