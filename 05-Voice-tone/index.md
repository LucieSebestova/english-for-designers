# Voice & Tone

This is the way I create my texts. ðŸ«¡

## Voice

- I try writes text as if I was having a conversation with someone
- I try to sound confident ðŸ¤—
- Easy to read?

## Tone

- Relax
- Friendly
- A bit formal (for instilling respect for the other side)
 

## Style

- I try to use my talking voice, so that I don't sound like a robot (but sometimes I sound like that ðŸ¥¹)
- Helpful
- Responsibly (trust)
